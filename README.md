**Backend**:
- Allow Reorder
- Count partial matches in match ratio
- Ignore dynamic values/IDs in HTML/XML/JSON
- Maybe some rules to ignore dynamic patterns inside body?


**Frontend**:

- Apply prismjs to content bodies: https://betterstack.dev/blog/code-highlighting-in-react-using-prismjs/
- Add D3.js graphics
